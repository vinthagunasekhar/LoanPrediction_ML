# Phase 1: Data Preprocessing and Feature Engineering Documentation

## Loan Prediction Project

### Overview of Phase 1

In the initial phase of our loan prediction project, we focused on transforming raw loan application data into a format
that machine learning models can effectively utilize. This document explains our methodology, decisions, and
implementation details for each step of the data preprocessing journey.

### Understanding Our Dataset

#### Initial Data Structure

Our dataset contains loan application records with several types of information:

1. **Personal Information**: Demographic details about loan applicants
2. **Financial Metrics**: Income and loan-related numerical data
3. **Property Information**: Details about the collateral property
4. **Target Variable**: Loan approval status (Y/N)

#### Key Challenges Identified

The raw data presented several challenges that needed addressing:

- Missing values across multiple columns requiring intelligent imputation
- Mixed data types requiring different handling approaches
- Skewed distributions in financial variables potentially affecting model performance
- Need for feature engineering to capture complex relationships

### Data Cleaning Implementation

#### Missing Value Treatment

We implemented different strategies based on the nature of each variable:

##### Categorical Variables

We used mode imputation for categorical variables, preserving the most frequent category:

```python
def handle_categorical_missing(df):
    categorical_vars = ['Gender', 'Married', 'Dependents', 'Self_Employed']
    for var in categorical_vars:
        df[var] = df[var].fillna(df[var].mode()[0])
```

*Rationale*: Mode imputation maintains the natural distribution of categorical variables while providing a reasonable
substitute for missing values.

##### Numerical Variables

We applied median imputation for numerical variables:

```python
def handle_numerical_missing(df):
    numerical_vars = ['LoanAmount', 'Loan_Amount_Term']
    for var in numerical_vars:
        df[var] = df[var].fillna(df[var].median())
```

*Rationale*: Median imputation is robust to outliers and preserves the central tendency of the distribution.

#### Special Case: Credit History

We created a dual approach for credit history:

```python
df['Credit_History_Missing'] = df['Credit_History'].isnull().astype(int)
df['Credit_History'] = df['Credit_History'].fillna(df['Credit_History'].mode()[0])
```

*Rationale*: This approach preserves information about missingness while maintaining the predictive power of the credit
history variable.

### Feature Engineering

#### Income-Based Features

We created several income-related features to capture different aspects of financial capacity:

1. **Total Household Income**:

```python
df['Total_Income'] = df['ApplicantIncome'] + df['CoapplicantIncome']
```

*Purpose*: Combines income sources to better represent household financial strength.

2. **Logarithmic Transformations**:

```python
df['Log_Total_Income'] = np.log(df['Total_Income'] + 1)
df['Log_ApplicantIncome'] = np.log(df['ApplicantIncome'] + 1)
df['Log_CoapplicantIncome'] = np.log(df['CoapplicantIncome'] + 1)
df['Log_LoanAmount'] = np.log(df['LoanAmount'] + 1)
```

*Purpose*:

- Normalizes skewed distributions
- Makes relationships more linear
- Reduces impact of outliers
- Improves model performance

#### Financial Ratios

1. **Income to Loan Ratio**:

```python
df['Income_to_Loan_Ratio'] = df['Total_Income'] / df['LoanAmount']
```

*Purpose*: Measures loan affordability relative to income.

2. **EMI Calculation**:

```python
df['EMI'] = (df['LoanAmount'] * 1000 * 0.1) / 12
```

*Purpose*: Estimates monthly payment obligations.

3. **Balance Income**:

```python
df['Balance_Income'] = df['Total_Income'] - df['EMI']
```

*Purpose*: Indicates disposable income after loan payments.

### Categorical Variable Encoding

#### Binary Variables

We used Label Encoding for binary variables:

```python
binary_features = ['Gender', 'Married', 'Self_Employed']
le = LabelEncoder()
for feature in binary_features:
    df[feature] = le.fit_transform(df[feature])
```

#### Ordinal Variables

Special handling for Dependents:

```python
df['Dependents'] = df['Dependents'].replace('3+', '3')
df['Dependents'] = pd.to_numeric(df['Dependents'])
```

#### Nominal Variables

One-hot encoding for nominal variables:

```python
nominal_features = ['Education', 'Property_Area']
df = pd.get_dummies(df, columns=nominal_features, drop_first=True)
```

### Quality Assurance

We implemented several validation checks:

1. **Missing Value Verification**:

```python
assert df.isnull().sum().sum() == 0, "Missing values still present"
```

2. **Data Type Verification**:

```python
numeric_columns = ['ApplicantIncome', 'CoapplicantIncome', 'LoanAmount']
assert all(df[col].dtype in ['int64', 'float64'] for col in numeric_columns)
```

### Results and Validation

The final processed dataset includes:

- 614 complete records
- No missing values
- Properly encoded categorical variables
- Engineered features with appropriate scales
- Preserved original features alongside transformations

### Technical Implementation Notes

#### Environment Setup

Required Python packages:

```python
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
from sklearn.preprocessing import LabelEncoder
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import seaborn as sns
```

#### Data Processing Pipeline

```python
def process_loan_data(raw_data):
    """
    Main processing pipeline for loan data
    """
    df = raw_data.copy()

    # 1. Handle missing values
    df = handle_missing_values(df)

    # 2. Engineer features
    df = engineer_features(df)

    # 3. Encode categorical variables
    df = encode_categories(df)

    # 4. Validate processing
    validate_processing(df)

    return df
```

### Next Steps for Phase 2

As we move into the modeling phase, we should:

1. Evaluate feature importance to validate our engineering decisions
2. Consider feature selection if needed
3. Monitor how different models perform with our engineered features
4. Be prepared to iterate on feature engineering based on model performance

### Conclusion

The preprocessing phase has successfully transformed our raw loan application data into a clean, engineered dataset
suitable for machine learning modeling. We've addressed key challenges while preserving important information and
creating meaningful new features that should enhance model performance in Phase 2.
